# Smarter to Barter

For this project, we aim to create a bartering app that allows users to trade services equally with one another.  The Smarter to Barter application can be used to offer services and seek services. This application will use Express.js in the back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. Our main motivation for this project is to create an application that will eliminate the burden of using cash to pay for services. Instead, this application allows users to barter with each other and earn points to use towards needed services instead of paying for services.
